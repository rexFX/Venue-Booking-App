# Venue-Booking-App

Minor Project (6th Semester)

An android app of https://github.com/itsadityap/Venue-Booking-Application which was created by my fellow team member of minor project.

### Features:

-   Users can signup as a requester and as an approver. Approver's signup is added for demo purpose, ideally they should be added by administrators only.

-   Users can send requests of bookings to approvers who can accept or reject their requests.

-   Notification and alert feature when a request is received, approved or rejected.
